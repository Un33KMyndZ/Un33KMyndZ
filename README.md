Hi, I'm @Un33KMyndZ, I'm interested in learning about ethical hacking and how to properly use devices and experience the technology phase as much as I am able too.
I'm currently learning slowly about GitHub and I guess you have to start somewhere and feel like others could help me with some begginer knowledge as well as experience.
I'm looking to collaborate and learn more about using the devices out there that many don't know about. I'd love to learn coding through Python and other methods and maybe one day
be able to build my own Raspberry Pi. How to reach me best would either be here on GitHub or on my private email account which is : xXhideNseekXx@protonmail.com
Thanks looking forward to learning some interesting tips/tricks, talk to you later!
